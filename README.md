## Challenges and pitfall in the use of partitioned gene counts for homoeologous gene expression and co-expression network analyses
---

### RNA-seq mapping and homoeolog read estimation
* [gsnap2polycat_120116.sh](gsnap2polycat_120116.sh) - GNASP mapping followed by PolyCat homoeolog read participation.
* [bowtie2hylite.sh](bowtie2hylite.sh) - Bowtie2 mapping followed by HyLite SNP detection and read participation, using [this](sam2_protocol_file.txt) protocol file.
* [bowtie2rsem.sh](https://github.com/huguanjing/AD1_RNA-seq/bowtie2rsem.sh)- Bowtie2 mapping with RSEM read estimation.
